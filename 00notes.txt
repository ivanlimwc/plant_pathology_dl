##############################

Place the zipped files in the Datasets folder on Teams to the Datasets folder here.

Unzip the zipped files in the Datasets folder to their own folder.
i.e., unzip plant_village to plant_village folder, so the file path will be like:
./Datasets/plant_village/Plant_leave_diseases_dataset_without_augmentation/Apple___Apple_scab

Datasets Source and Prep down:

Please download the related datasets and put them in the path of dataset_dir 
(e.g., /home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/).
(Note: already prepped to folder on Github, unless you want to prepare yourself)

Plant Village: i.e., plant_village (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1). 
Please download Plant_leaf_diseases_dataset_without_augmentation.zip(828MB), 
then unzip it and rename the folder name to plant_village 
(Note: please remove sub-folder Background_without_leaves in Plant_leave_diseases_dataset_without_augmentation). 
Ensure the path looks like this: 
/home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/plant_village/Plant_leave_diseases_dataset_without_augmentation/Apple___Apple_scab.



Plant Leaves: i.e., plant_leaves (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/hb74ynkjcn/1). 
Please click download All (6718 MB) and put them in a folder which should be named plant_leaves. 
Combine the sub-folder name and sub-sub-folder names. 
E.g., Alstonia Scholaris (P2)  has diseased & healthy, then rename them to AlstoniaScholaris_diseased & AlstoniaScholaris_healthy.
Ensure the path looks like this: /home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/plant_leaves/AlstoniaScholaris_diseased.



PlantDoc-0.2: i.e., PlantDoc (https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset) 
Please download PlantDoc-Dataset and rename the folder name to PlantDoc_Dataset.
Please remove the folder Tomato two spotted spider mites leaf which has only two pictures in the train folder first. 
Please copy all items from the test folder to the train folder 
(Note: the image names are case sensitive, and may not be suitable for some Windows environments). 
Ensure the path looks like this: /home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/PlantDoc_Dataset/train.



PlantDoc-1.0: i.e., PlantDoc_original (https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset) 
Please download PlantDoc-Dataset and rename the folder name to PlantDoc_original.
Please remove the folder Tomato two spotted spider mites leaf which has only two pictures in the train folder first. 
Please keep the test folder and the train folder 
(Note: the image names are case sensitive, and may not be suitable for some Windows environments). 
Ensure the path looks like this: /home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/PlantDoc_original/train 
and /home/user/Leaf_diseases/Datasets/PlantDoc_original/test.



Other issues but doesnt seem critical:
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
tensorflow 2.6.0 requires clang~=5.0, which is not installed.
tensorflow 2.6.0 requires keras>=2.4.0, which is not installed.
tensorboard 2.6.0 requires google-auth<2,>=1.6.3, but you have google-auth 2.6.0 which is incompatible.
tensorflow 2.6.0 requires absl-py~=0.10, but you have absl-py 1.3.0 which is incompatible.
tensorflow 2.6.0 requires flatbuffers~=1.12, but you have flatbuffers 20210226132247 which is incompatible.
